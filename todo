#find diffusion stepsize stuff again
#    - Missing: add new interpol coeffs to program

RE-attempt analytical calculation with proper rotation 

Investigate trajectories
    - Sort of done

think/read about frames (especially for shock crossing)

eventually implement shock frame crossing

Read



TODAY:

# compare interpolation with litterature

Investigate:
    - Energy gain at crossing (ev. cycle) -- average
    - Distribution of cross-angles
    - Maybe some simple visualisations of "flow"

Implement:
    - Full lorentz transform at shock crossing

Time development of random walk distribution (vs diffusion)
    - Plot at time samples (possible production plot)
    - Animation?


Theoretical value of D-coeff (right units etc.)
