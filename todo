find diffusion stepsize stuff again
RE-attempt analytical calculation with proper rotation 
Investigate trajectories
Read
think/read about frames (especially for shock crossing)
eventually implement shock frame crossing

Implement:
    - Full lorentz transform at shock crossing

Investigate:
    - Energy gain at crossing (ev. cycle) -- average
    - Distribution of cross-angles
    - Maybe some simple visualisations of "flow"
